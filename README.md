# State-flow-model-of-a-gripping-mechanism-using-MATLAB

We are designing a gripper actuated using four-bar mechanism. It has four states depending on the power and pushbuttons. The states are:
  • Stop.
  • Start.
  • Forward Motion.
  • Backward Motion.
  • Gripping.
  
  Forward Motion, Backward Motion, and Gripping states are indicated by three LEDs. Each motion is actuated using its pushbuttons or by command from the mobile application. The mobile application is communicating with the Arduino using Bluetooth module. Potentiometer is used to select slow or rapid motion of the four-bar mechanism (Stepper motor). The State is displayed live on the LCD display.
